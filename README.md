# Pokémon Card Database

## About

I am a very dedicated Pokémon Card collector.
I have created this project as a way to organize my thousands of cards and learn
more about website development. Originally I had a large spreadsheet, however 
this didn't have all the usabilty that I would have preferred. Now I am in the 
process of taking my spreadsheet and turning into a website I can access anywhere.

## Process For Adding Sets

This is a reminder for me because I will forget what I need to do in the future.

- Add set and it's information to `csvFiles/infofiles/setsinfo.csv`
- Add set icon and title image to `docs/images/sets/`
- Create csv file for set
- Run `scripts/checkcsv.awk` on the newly created csv file
- Run `build.sh` to build the site


## Credits

Most, if not all images were gotten from
